    <p><b>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj Mahal?</b> <br><br>

        Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.<br><br>
        
        At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than <br> building a marble masterpiece for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing <br> its magnificence up close.<br><br>
        
        After all, this is art. Built in Agra, <a href="INDIA.PNG">India</a> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s <br> the perfect opportunity to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj <br> Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide, enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from <br> Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.<br> <br>
        
        Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), <br> and so much more…</p>
<p>
    <b>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</b> <br><br>
That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.<br><br>

Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian men, women and children who may ask to take photos with you.<br><br>

To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. <br>
Intrepid have Taj-visiting trips that range from <a href="pic4.png">8-day Golden Triangle tours </a> (now with <a href="pic5.png">solo-only <br> departures!</a>) 
to <a href="pic6.PNG"> 15 day's trips dedicated food </a>, to 19-Day trips combining the <a href="pic7.png">highlights of India <br>
and Nepal.</a><br>

If you’re more pressed for time, you can check out the Taj Mahal on a whirlwind day tour from <br>
Delhi. Check out Urban Adventures to see the itinerary that we’d recommend for this.
And while <br> you’re at it, check out their day trips in <a href="#">Delhi, Jaipur,</a> Varanasi and Mumbai!<br><br>

The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally prepared, <br>
you’ll be fine. What’s to come is more than worth the wait…

    <p>
        <b>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</b><br>
        Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have <br> minimal belongings on you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.<br><br>
        You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Passport</li>
        <li>Money</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Medicine</li>
        <li>Camera</li>
        <li>Phone</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>
        What to wear to the Taj Mahal </b><br><br>
        There is no dress code but you should still be respectful.
        If you want to enter the mosque, you will <br> need to cover your head, shoulders and knees.<br> <br>
        It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear <br> 
        sunscreen. Then again, Agra also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.<br><br>
        If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid<br>the worst of the heat.<br><br>
        <img src="pic8.PNG"><br><br>
        <p><b>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:<br><br></b>
           Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are 
           <br>easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are 
           <br>to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of 
           <br>laces are hard!</p><br>
           <p>
            <b>Other things you need to know</b><br><br>
            No food is allowed inside.<br><br>
            Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.<br><br>
            Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. 
            <br>Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small 
            <br> video cameras) are not allowed.<br><br>
            Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your 
            <br>wits about you and you won’t need to worry!
           </p>
           <p>
            <b>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</b><br><br>
              Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if <br>
              possible).<br><br>
              <img src="pic9.PNG">
           </p><br><br>
           <p>
             If you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an 
             <br>amazing photo from the riverbank behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to 
             <br>take you there and back cheaply.)<br><br>
            And simply focus on taking in all the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly 
            <br>(or more!) remain in awe of it. <a href="#">Sana Jinah,</a> one of the company’s inspiring female tour guides, has 
            <br>some tips on how to do this:<br><br>
             The Taj Mahal is a place for exploring quietly on your own or with loved ones. So, once I’m 
             <br>done briefing my groups I give them a good 2-3 hours inside the Taj. There are ways I try to 
             <br>make the experience special and memorable for travelers, but if I say what they are then 
             <br>they will no longer be surprises!<br>
             The Taj has such a charm. Every time I see it it looks different (due to the direction of the 
             <br>sunlight). It’s so beautiful…<br><br><br>
            She also recommends those looking for optimum conditions try visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise 
            <br>on a clear day.
           </p><br><br>
           <p><b>Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</b><br><br>
            Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit 
            <br>on the bench and the grandeur of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.<br><br>
            <img src="pic10.PNG">
    </p><br>
    <p>
        But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth seeking out.<br><br>
 
        Below are some photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <a href="#">Pravin \
        <br>Tamang.</a> (His photography is amazing – <a href="#">check it out!)</a>

       <ul>
        <li>Shot from the arch of the main doorway</li>
        <li>Capture the reflection of the fountains that line the route towards the Taj Mahal’s main platform</li>
        <li>Shot of Taj Mahal from the riverside with the reflection on the river</li>
        <li>Shot from the other side of the river, ‘Mehtab Bagh’, where you get a glimpse of Taj</li>
        <li>The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort</li>
       </ul> <br><br>
        <p>You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. 
        <br>Unfortunately, Agra does get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the 
        <br>day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots look very atmospheric!<br><br>

    </p><br><br>
       <p> <b>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</b><br><br>
           First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. 
           Then <br>explore these cool destinations both in and out of Agra:<br><br>
           <b>What to do in Agra </b><br><br>
           The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. But the Agra Fort 
           is<br>also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century 
           <br>Mughal monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, it’s a sight not to be missed.<br><br>
           Despite being located on the <a href="#">Golden Triangle </a>tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than 
           in<br>many other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you 
           <br>likely won’t spend too long there, whatever the trip.<br><br>
           One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by 
           <br>(sometimes) taking travelers to <a>Sheroes Hangout.</a> Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe
           <br>run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims of attacks are employed and tell their
           <br>stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.<br><br>

    <p>
       <b>Where to go outside of Agra</b><br><br>
          There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these, 
          <br>Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.<br><br>
         Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic, laid-back 
         <br>and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit 
         <br>it on <a href="#">this 15-day trip</a> from <a href="#">Delhi to Kathmandu</a> (cooking demo and palace visit included!).<br><br>
         <img src="pic13.PNG"> 
        </p> <br><br>
        <p>
            Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the <a>‘Pink City’,</a> the capital of Rajasthan is full of 
            <br>chaos, charm and unique architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting 
            <br>bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city to take it all in.<br><br>
            Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home 
            <br>to Pushkar Lake, a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy 
            <br>nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. Visit on this <a href="pic17.PNG">15-day trip</a> all around 
            <br>Rajasthan.

            <b>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</b><br><br>
               As you may have <a href="#">read</a> or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough 
               <br>clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask as of April 2018.<br><br>
               Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white 
               <br>surfaces yellow – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – 
               <br>applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried 
               <br>out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series of restorative projects 
               <br>carried out on the historic site.<br><br>
